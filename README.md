# pokerhands-java-challenge
 
The project simulates a deck of standard playing cards. The deck of cards consists of a group of card objects, with each 
card having a rank (Ace - King) and a suite (Diamonds, hearts, clubs and spades)

You should be able to construct a hand, which can contain any number of cards, less than 52.
With a hand of 5 cards, you should be able to retrieve a hand rank and also be able to compare two hands of 5 cards 
using comparators.  Details for the hand rankings can be found here: http://www.wsop.com/poker-hands/
